# StudentRecords

This is a project given to us and we have to write a program that will retrieve student data from a text file and display it in a specific format:
“Name: (Name), Class: (Class), Dept: (Dept)”

So I created a ReadLine() that actually reads the existing text file RecordsOf Student.txt in the DataStructuredRecord Class, and then displays the details as specified.

Also later were asked to use the Data Structure, Search and Sort algorithm to retrieve the data from the file and then make the data displayed on screen after being sorted. 
They should also be able to search a student by name.

So I created a functions like SearchElement() and SortFile()stores and uses the data from the existing text file RecordsOf Student.txt in the DataStructuredRecord Class, and do the task.
